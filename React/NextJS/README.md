# [Next JS](https://nextjs.org)

## What is Next.js?
### Why Next.js
#### Zero Config
Automatic compilation and bundling. Optimized for production from the start.
#### Hybrid: SSG and SSR
Pre-render pages at build time (SSG) or request time (SSR) in a single project.
#### File-system Routing
Every component in the `pages` directory becomes a route.
#### TypeScript Support
Automatic TypeScript configuration and compilation.
#### API Routes
Optionally create API endpoints to provide backend functionality.
